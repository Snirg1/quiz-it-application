About
"Empathy" â€“ the ability to share someone else's feelings or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that person's situation (Cambridge dictionary)

The other side is a game to develop self awareness and empathy for every person that leads or guides others.
The game increases awareness by exposing the contenders to a different points of view of those around them.
How is the situation experienced by them from "The other side"?
And how we can communicate in a more empathic way.
At the game we will be presenting every day situations and different ways to act.
The different courses of action will be presented over the cards as this one.
Throughout the game we will learn how our action can get interpreted by the other person, although sometimes our good intentions aren't as expected.

Empathy is a superpower when communicating with people. It would be good if they added it to the drinking water.
Until then, we hope you will find our game helpful.
