About
"Empathy" â€“ the ability to share someone else's feelings or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that person's situation (Cambridge dictionary)

The other side is a game to develop self awareness and empathy for every person that leads or guides others.
In addition to increasing awareness, the game provides participants with a glimpse into others' opinions.

From "the other side", how do they perceive the situation?

The game will show us every day situations and ways we can react to them.
Different courses of action will be presented on cards such as this one.
Our good intentions aren't always interpreted the way we thought they would be, so we will learn how our actions can get interpreted by others throughout the game.

Empathy is a superpower when communicating with people. It would be good if it were added to the drinking water.
Until then, we hope our game is helpful to you.
