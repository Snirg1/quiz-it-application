               <b>"Empathy"</b> â€“ the ability to share someone else's feelings
               or experiences by imagining what it would be like to be in that
               person's situation.
               <br />
               <br />
               The other side is a game to develop self awareness and empathy
               for every person that leads or guides others.
               <br />
               In addition to increasing awareness, the game provides
               participants with a glimpse into others' opinions.
               <br />
               From "the other side", how do they perceive the situation?
               <br />
               The game will show us every day situations and ways we can react
               to them.
               <br />
               Different courses of action will be presented on cards such as
               this one.
               <br />
               Our good intentions aren't always interpreted the way we thought
               they would be, so we will learn how our actions can get
               interpreted by others throughout the game.
               <br />
               Empathy is a superpower when communicating with people. It would
               be good if it were added to the drinking water.
               <br />
               Until then, we hope our game is helpful to you!
